* Add Openshift client location to PATH
* Install *powershift-cli* as describe at the Github project link:https://github.com/getwarped/powershift-cli[powershift-cli] (Windows wrapper util for *Openshift client*)

== How to run locally
Use the following command to build and run the service locally.

`mvn -s configuration/settings.xml -P default clean clean install spring-boot:run -DCONFIG_LOCATION_EXTERNAL=classpath:/development-application.properties`

The parameter **CONFIG_LOCATION_EXTERNAL** defines the fully qualified path to the file developer-application.properties,
which is located in `src/main/resources`.


== How to run in Openshift
This section describes how to run the service in a local Openshift cluster.

=== Preconditions
Make sure that the wsdl location of the conax service points to the proper location in the following files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/main/fabric8/configmap.yml` +
  When ran in Openshift

=== Windows
This section describes how to start the local Openshift cluster on a windows machine with *powershift-cli*.

* Start Docker for Windows
* Open a Powershell
* Start the cluster with `powershift.exe cluster up [profile_name]`
* Wait until cluster is started
* Login to your Openshift project with `oc.exe login [CLUSTER_URL] -u developer -p developer`

=== Build and deploy
This section describes how to build and deploy the service via the maven plugin *fabric8-maven-plugin*.
Ensure you are logged in to your Openshift project via the CLI and that the openshift client binary location has been added to the PATH.

* `mvn -s configuration/settings.xml -P default,fabric8 clean install fabric8:deploy` +
  Deploy the service in the openshift project
* `mvn -s configuration/settings.xml -P default,fabric8 clean compile fabric8:undeploy` +
  Undeploy the service from the openshift project

The parameter **CONFIG_LOCATION_EXTERNAL** is set in the `src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml`, which references a ConfigMap key,
which is is defined in `src/main/fabric8/configmap.yml`.
